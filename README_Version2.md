# my_data_analysis — Spark-based Big Data ML Exercises

Welcome — this repository contains a set of machine learning exercises designed for university coursework that demonstrate how to use Apache Spark for big data analysis. The examples are intended to teach data ingestion, preprocessing, feature engineering, scalable model training (Spark MLlib), model evaluation, and simple hyperparameter tuning on medium-to-large datasets.

> Note: This README is written to be implementation-agnostic so you can adapt it to run locally, on a cluster, or in cloud notebooks (Databricks, EMR, etc.). Update paths and commands below to match your environment.

## What you'll find here
- Example Spark jobs (PySpark) that demonstrate typical ML workflows:
  - data loading and cleaning
  - feature engineering (VectorAssembler, StringIndexer, OneHotEncoder, scaling)
  - building pipelines and training models with Spark MLlib
  - evaluating and persisting models
  - simple hyperparameter search with CrossValidator or TrainValidationSplit
- (Optional) Jupyter notebooks demonstrating the same concepts interactively — check `/notebooks` if present.
- Sample scripts under `/scripts` or `/examples` (adjust to your repo layout).
- Guidance and runnable commands to execute with spark-submit or within an interactive PySpark session.

## Repository structure (example)
The actual layout may vary. Typical layout:
- README.md — this file
- examples/ or scripts/ — PySpark example scripts
- notebooks/ — Jupyter notebooks (if included)
- data/ — small sample datasets for quick testing (do not store large data here)
- docs/ — additional documentation or notes
- requirements.txt — Python dependencies (if present)

If your repository uses different directories, replace the paths in the examples below.

## Prerequisites
- Java 8 or 11
- Apache Spark 3.x (or compatible Spark version used in the examples)
- Python 3.8+ (for PySpark scripts)
- pip and virtualenv (recommended) or conda
- Optional: Docker, Databricks, EMR, or another managed Spark environment for larger-scale runs

Install Python dependencies locally (if a requirements file exists):
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
If there is no requirements.txt, at minimum install pyspark for local development:
```bash
pip install pyspark
```

## Quickstart — running a PySpark example locally
1. Start a Spark session (local mode) inside a Python script or notebook:
```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

spark = SparkSession.builder \
    .appName("example") \
    .master("local[*]") \
    .getOrCreate()
```
2. Run an example script directly:
```bash
python examples/train_model.py --input data/sample.csv --output models/
```
(Adjust script name and CLI args to match actual files.)

3. Using spark-submit (recommended for closer parity with cluster runs):
```bash
$SPARK_HOME/bin/spark-submit \
  --master local[*] \
  --deploy-mode client \
  examples/train_model.py \
  --input data/large_dataset.parquet \
  --output models/
```

## Quickstart — running on a cluster / cloud
- Upload your code and data to the cluster (HDFS / S3 / DBFS).
- Use spark-submit pointing to your cluster's master (yarn, spark://, or the cloud provider's launcher).
- Ensure the Python environment and dependencies are available on executors (use --py-files or build a wheel/egg, or use conda/virtualenv on cluster nodes).

Example (Spark on YARN):
```bash
$SPARK_HOME/bin/spark-submit \
  --master yarn \
  --deploy-mode cluster \
  --py-files dist/my_project.zip \
  examples/train_model.py \
  --input s3a://your-bucket/datasets/your-data \
  --output s3a://your-bucket/models/
```

## Typical ML workflow used in the exercises
1. Data ingestion (CSV, Parquet, JSON, JDBC, S3)
2. Data cleaning and exploration using DataFrame APIs
3. Feature engineering: string indexing, categorical encoding, vector assembly, scaling
4. Building Spark ML Pipelines to chain transformers and estimators
5. Model training and evaluation (classification/regression metrics)
6. Hyperparameter tuning with CrossValidator or TrainValidationSplit
7. Saving and loading models with MLWriter/MLReader

## Configurable parameters
Most example scripts accept arguments for:
- input path
- output path (models / predictions)
- number of partitions / parallelism
- model hyperparameters or the path to a config file

Run:
```bash
python examples/train_model.py --help
```
or check the top of each example script for supported flags.

## Datasets
- Small sample data for quick iteration may be stored in `data/`.
- For realistic experiments, use larger datasets on HDFS/S3 or other distributed storage.
- Do not include large raw datasets in this repo.

## Testing and validation
- Unit tests (if present) can be run via pytest:
```bash
pytest tests/
```
- For integration tests (Spark jobs), run them in local mode with smaller datasets.

## Troubleshooting
- "ClassNotFoundException" or dependency issues on the cluster: package all required Python modules and make them available to executors (use --py-files or a cluster-wide environment).
- Memory issues: tune driver and executor memory via spark-submit flags:
  --driver-memory, --executor-memory, --executor-cores, and adjust parallelism.
- Unexpected skew: increase partitions or use salting strategies in joins.

## Extending the exercises
- Add more datasets and notebook walkthroughs.
- Implement additional models (Gradient-Boosted Trees, Random Forests, ALS for recommendation).
- Add evaluation dashboards and experiment tracking (MLflow, TensorBoard, or a custom logger).

If you want, I can:
- Tailor this README to the exact files and layout in your repository (I can scan the repo and update paths/commands).
- Add runnable examples and polished spark-submit commands using the precise script names.
- Draft a CONTRIBUTING.md and simple scripts to bootstrap a local dev environment.

Tell me which of these you'd like next and I will update the README or add files accordingly.
